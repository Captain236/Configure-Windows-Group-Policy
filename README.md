# Configure-Windows-Group-Policy

## What is Group Policy?
**Group Policy is a Windows Server feature that allows administrators to set rules and manage settings for users and computers in a network.**

**ðŸ‘‰ With Group Policy, an admin can:**

**Block or allow access to Control Panel**

**Enforce password policies (length, complexity, expiry)**

**Restrict or allow software installations**

**Set desktop wallpaper or system configurations for all users**

**In this project, I configured Group Policy in Windows Server to manage user restrictions. First, I created two users and applied a domain-level policy to block the Control Panel. Then, I created an Organizational Unit (Demo OU) and moved one user into it. Finally, I linked the Group Policy to the OU, ensuring the restriction was applied only to that specific user. This project demonstrates practical skills in Active Directory management, Group Policy configuration, and policy scoping.**

## Steps
**1:- First, I created two users in Active Directory to demonstrate this project.**
